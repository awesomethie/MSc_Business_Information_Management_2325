# 🍽️ HelloFresh x GenAI: Transforming the Meal Kit Industry with Generative AI

📌 Project Overview

This project outlines a strategic proposal for integrating Generative AI (GenAI) into HelloFresh, a leading Dutch subscription-based meal kit service. As consumer expectations for personalization and convenience grow, GenAI offers HelloFresh an opportunity to shift from a linear supplier model to an ecosystem-driven platform, enhancing customer experience, operational efficiency, and competitive advantage.
