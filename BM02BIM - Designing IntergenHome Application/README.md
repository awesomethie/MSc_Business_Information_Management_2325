# 🏡 IntergenHome: Bridging Generations Through Smart Housing

## 📌 Project Overview

**IntergenHome** is a digital platform that matches elderly homeowners with students seeking affordable housing in the Netherlands. By offering reduced rent in exchange for light caregiving or companionship, the platform tackles two major societal issues: the student housing crisis and elderly loneliness.
