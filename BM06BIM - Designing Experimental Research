# 🧪 Online Review Norms & Experimental Design

---

## 📖 Exercise 1: Experiment Analysis 

### 🎯 Research Focus
Investigates how **space norms** influence **review quality behavior** on consumer review sites.

### 🧩 Key Constructs
- **IV**: Space Norms (High vs. Low)
- **DV**: Review Quality
- **Moderator**: Social Presence

### 🧪 Design & Validity
- Randomized lab experiment with 3 groups
- Measurements: machine learning + human-coded
- Validity: high internal, limited external (student sample)

### ⚠️ Critique
- No power analysis for sample size
- Social Presence not manipulated
- Limited generalizability

## 🧪 Exercise 2: Custom Experimental Design

### ❓ Research Question
Are customers more likely to leave a review if they receive a **malfunctioning** product?

### 🧱 Design Summary
- **Online simulated shopping** (desk lamp scenario)
- 3 conditions: fully functional, partially, completely malfunctioning
- Monetary incentive (€20)
- Review intent and satisfaction measured

### ✅ Validity & Checks
- Attention & manipulation checks via dummy questions
- Control for demographics & prior review behavior
- External validity enhanced via realistic interface & potential DiD with real-world data

### 📊 Analysis
- **Logistic Regression** for H1 (review likelihood)
- **Bootstrapped Mediation** for H2 (satisfaction as mediator)
